## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript (Vanilla)
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - Preprocessor CSS

### What I learned

Hi everyone! I did this challenge mainly to review the use of grids in the main layout; it was quite simple, as it was necessary to order 3 main blocks such as the "Hero image", the inside containing 3 article previews and the area below containing 3 other articles.

This time I tried using SASS for compiling the CSS, as it's a technology I'm also brushing up on right now and I wanted to test myself. I certainly didn't make the best use of the syntax, I probably made some repetition and lengthening of avoidable code.

Overall it was fun and useful at the same time, let me know if you like how you found this solution and suggest me some better solution.

### Continued development

In the near future I want to continue to master and improve the use of grids and flexbox for layout construction, then I want to improve the use of SASS for compiling and speeding up CSS and become more and more familiar with Javascript.
